## About Me 

        Hi my name is Marshall Hotaling (He/Him) I'm a junior Software Developer on my journey to become a senior developer. What made me choose this career was my love for technology, and
    watching my father code and make computers as a kid. It was just the seed that planted the tree of admiration I have for technology now. With that I joined my IT group in 
    high school as well as my AP coding class which was my first footprint in the world of coding. Then a year later, I was introduced to the school of Turing. Now that you know 
    a little bit about me, let me show you what I know.

### Functionality 
- A user first picks a park, then they're shown a description of the park they chose and an array of animals that live in that park.
- Then the user can click on an animal to be shown an animal card which has a description of the animal and four options: 
- Favorite the animal to see and track it. 
- Eat which shows what the animal you chose eats. 
- Eat Me which shows you what eats the animal you chose. 
- And Draw me which will show you to a video on how you can draw the animal. 
- Then the game is to see what makes the top of the tree of life with a nice little message telling you that you made it to an apex predator.

### Personal contributions
CSS/styling, fetch and post calls to the database, along with eat and eat me functionality
